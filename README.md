# CSharp-Entity-Framework-Core----code-first-migration-updates

**Purpose:** This practice is designed to continue to get familiarization with the fundamentals of using Entity Framework to generate and update a database. 
This scenario is for when you would like to build your server and database both using C#. 
For this practice we will be expanding upon the Entity Framework - Code First Migration practice by adding more columns to our “Shelves” table and adding more tables as well.

**Requirements:**
* Use Entity Framework Practice - Code First Migration practice as a starting point for this practice.
* Modify the “Shelf” model:
  * A database table called “Shelf” with:
  * An int primary key called ID.
  * A varchar of length 50 called “Name”.
  * A foreign key to ShelfMaterial(ID) called “ShelfMaterialID”.
  * The requisite virtual properties and constructors for references.
* Create a “ShelfMaterial” model:
  * A database table called “Shelf_Material” with:
  * An int primary key called “ID”.
  * A varchar of length 25 called “MaterialName”.
  * The requisite virtual properties for references.
* Use Entity Framework to update the “codefirst_practice” database using your models.
  * This must be done in a migration. 
* Update your code in Program.cs to include:
  * An input a shelf material name (a parameter if you created a method).
    * Ensure the material exists in the “Shelf_Material” table.
    * If the material does not exist, let the user know and exit.
    * The material input should be case insensitive.
    * The material input should be trimmed.
  * When the user enters a valid material and you add the new shelf, ensure the foreign key for “ShelfMaterial” is populated correctly.
